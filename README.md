# GitUp-RS

A Rust implementation of GitUp - A fast Git client for macOS.

## Overview

This project is a phased migration of GitUp from Objective-C to Rust, aiming to:
- Improve performance with Rust's zero-cost abstractions
- Enhance memory safety
- Enable cross-platform support
- Maintain compatibility with existing GitUp features

## Project Structure
