Enhanced Graph Integration
==========================

The enhanced graph has been successfully integrated into the GitUp TUI!

## How to Use

1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

2. Run the TUI:
   ```bash
   ./target/release/gitup tui .
   ```

3. In the TUI, on the Commits tab:
   - Press `E` to toggle Enhanced Graph mode (GitKraken-style rendering)
   - Press `v` to toggle the regular graph view
   - Use `j`/`k` or arrow keys to navigate
   - Press `g` to go to top, `G` to go to bottom
   - Use `Ctrl-d`/`Ctrl-u` for page down/up

## Features

The enhanced graph provides:
- ✅ Seamless viewport scrolling (no line breaks)
- ✅ Proper CJK/emoji text support
- ✅ Compact lane compression algorithm
- ✅ Priority-based edge routing for conflicts
- ✅ Smart carry-over for viewport edges
- ✅ Charset profile detection
- ✅ Efficient rendering (O(h) complexity)

## Implementation Details

The enhanced graph module (`graph/`) includes:
- **Core DAG abstraction** for commit history
- **Compact layout algorithm** with lane reuse
- **Viewport virtualization** for large repos
- **Cell routing** with conflict resolution
- **CJK text support** with proper width calculation
- **Seamless viewport** with carry-over state

The integration layer (`gitup-ui/src/enhanced_graph.rs`) bridges the new graph module with the existing TUI infrastructure, providing:
- Repository loading via `GitWalker`
- Compact row building with lane compression
- Rendering to ratatui buffers
- Keyboard navigation support
- Dynamic charset profile detection

## Next Steps

Future enhancements (commits 14-20) could include:
- Theme support with customizable colors
- Lane locking for branch tracking
- Performance caching for large repos
- Full i18n support
- Path filtering for focused views
- Action guards for safe operations
