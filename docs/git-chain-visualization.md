# Git Chain Visualization Implementation

## 🎯 Overview

Successfully implemented a Git graph visualization feature for the Terminal UI that displays commit chains, branches, and their relationships in an ASCII art format.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. **Core Data Structures**
- `GitGraph`: Main graph structure containing nodes and edges
- `GraphNode`: Represents each commit with lane assignment
- `GraphEdge`: Represents relationships between commits
- `GraphBuilder`: Algorithm for constructing the graph from commits

### 2. **ASCII Art Renderer**
- Beautiful ASCII symbols for different commit types:
  - `●` Regular commit
  - `◉` Merge commit
  - `◎` HEAD commit
- Lane-based layout with proper edge routing
- Color coding for different branches (8 color palette)
- Branch and tag labels inline with commits

### 3. **Integration with TUI**
- Toggle between graph and list view with 'g' key
- Maintains selection state when switching views
- Shows graph by default in Commits tab
- Proper navigation with j/k keys

## 📊 Technical Implementation

### Graph Building Algorithm
```rust
// Lane assignment algorithm
1. Process commits in topological order
2. Try to reuse parent's lane for continuity
3. Assign new lanes when needed
4. Track active lanes to minimize crossings
```

### Rendering Pipeline
```rust
1. Build graph structure from commits
2. Assign lanes to minimize edge crossings
3. Render graph lines and nodes
4. Add commit information with branch/tag labels
5. Apply selection highlighting
```

## 🎮 User Controls

| Key | Action | Description |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| `g` | Toggle graph | Switch between graph and list view |
| `j/k` | Navigate | Move up/down in the graph |
| `Enter` | View files | See files changed in selected commit |
| `h/l` | Switch tabs | Navigate between tabs |

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
gitup-ui/
├── git_graph.rs       # Core graph data structures
├── graph_renderer.rs  # ASCII art rendering engine
└── tui.rs            # Integration with main UI
```

### Key Components

1. **GitGraph Structure**
   - Stores all nodes and edges
   - Maintains topological order
   - Tracks branch and tag references

2. **GraphRenderer**
   - Converts graph to ASCII art
   - Handles lane assignments
   - Manages color coding
   - Renders branch/tag labels

3. **GraphWidget**
   - Ratatui widget wrapper
   - Handles selection highlighting
   - Manages viewport scrolling

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Interactive Navigation**
   - Jump to parent/child commits with h/l
   - Jump to branch points with { }
   - Search commits with /

2. **Enhanced Visualization**
   - Show commit stats inline
   - Display author avatars
   - Add commit time indicators
   - Show remote tracking branches

3. **Git Operations**
   - Cherry-pick from graph
   - Interactive rebase visualization
   - Merge/rebase directly from graph

4. **Performance**
   - Lazy loading for large repos
   - Virtual scrolling
   - Incremental graph updates

## 📝 Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Start TUI with graph view
./target/release/gitup-ui .

# Toggle graph view
# Press 'g' in Commits tab
```

### Navigation
```bash
# In graph view:
j/k - Move selection up/down
Enter - View commit's files
g - Toggle back to list view
q - Quit
```

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. Parent IDs not yet populated (using empty vec temporarily)
2. Tags not yet implemented (placeholder for future)
3. Buffer deprecation warnings (can be fixed with newer API)

## ✨ Summary

The Git chain visualization feature successfully brings visual commit history to the Terminal UI. Users can now see the branching structure, merge points, and commit relationships at a glance, making it easier to understand the repository's history.

The implementation provides a solid foundation for future enhancements and can be extended with more interactive features as needed.
